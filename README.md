**Thanks to Fran√ßois for featuring this Windows 8 theme in [his blog](https://www.framboise314.fr/raspberry-pi-os-avec-un-look-de-windows-8/)!**
## Credit:
- The icon theme is originally from [the B00merang project](https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-10). Customizations were added by [the TwisterOS team](https://twisteros.com/). Botspot further customized the icon theme to be compatible with Raspbian.
- The GTK theme is based on [the B00merang project](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Windows-10). Botspot heavily modified it to work best with Raspbian.
- The mouse cursor theme is non-modified Windows 8.1 mouse cursor theme, gotten from [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1084938/).
- The openbox theme was designed from scratch by Botspot.
- Xcompmgr adds transparency and shadows to windows. Non-modified.
- The 'custom panel' is actually two panels, one over the other. The lower one is `lxpanel`, and Botspot designed the entire theme from scratch. The upper one is `tint2`, and Botspot designed all the taskbar elements from scratch. This double-panel approach is necessary to  better mimic Windows 8. No other Windows 8 theme for any Linux OS is as realistic as this theme.
